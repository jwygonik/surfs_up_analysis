# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to help our investor client examine the aggregate temperature data for Oahu to demonstrate whether this climate suitable city to start a Surf and Shake Shop. 

## Results

* The average temperature for June in Oahu is a little under 75 degrees, the average temperature for December is approximately 71 degrees. This does not seem to be a cause for concern as 4 degrees is not a huge difference. Especially considering December is generally considered one of the coldest months. Temperatures in the 70's are condusive to the weather that would drive sales in the Surf and Shake shop. 

* While the minimum temperatures are less than ideal for driving shake sales, it would still be warm enough for customers to surf those days if they really wanted to. The temperatures across the board appear to be pretty mild. 


* The standard deviation of temperatures for both months is between 3-4 degrees. Considering the average temperatures are pleasant and warm, this fluctuation would not be cause for concern either. 


## Summary

When taking the aggregate temperatures for one of the Summer months (June) and one of the Winter months (December), the data seems to support that this climate would be the ideal place to open a business centered around Surfing and Shakes. The warm weather would encourage outdoor sports year round and maintain the cash flow from selling ice cream and other warm-weather favorites. Overall the weather for this area appears to be consistent throughout the year. When this area does hit it's lower temperatures, it will not be cause for concern as the average maintains higher throughout the majority of the year. Even on the coldest days for that area, there would still be a market for at least one of the two specialties.
